Not really much of a guide necessary for this one. The challenge is pretty
well documented as far as what's expected from the developer; use
built-in array methods and perform the necessary operations to provide
the expected values. Easy peasy.

If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript array methods, Mozilla docs are your
friend.

The following built-in Array methods will be utilized to solve this challenge:
- [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)
- [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Sort)
- [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter)

Woooooooo all done with day 4!
