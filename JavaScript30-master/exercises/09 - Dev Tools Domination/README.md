# Exercise 9: Dev Tools Domination

This is a simple dev tools exercise. We'll explore how to set _break points_
  in the browser debugger, and learn about various `console` methods that allow us
  to be more specific about the event being logged out (is it a warning, an error,
  a collection of data, etc.).

## Guide

A guide isn't necessary for this exercise. In this challenge I made some *minor* changes
  when compared to Wes' original answer key, mostly to provide some additional clarification
  about the uses of the various `console` methods.

The [index.html](./index.html) file is completely notated; take a look and if you still have
  questions don't hesitate to contact me.

**Challenge 9 feelin' fine wooooooooooo**
