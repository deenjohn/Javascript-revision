# Exercise 16: Mouse Move Shadow

We're given an HTML document with a `div` element containing an `h1` element.
  The `h1` element has a `textShadow` _style property_ which we want to manipulate
  depending on the user's current mouse location. Write the necessary JavaScript
  code to bring functionality to this page.

## Guide

In the `<script>` tag, we're provided with three `const` (constant) variables: one
  which references the `div` element with class `hero`, one which references the `h1` element
  that is a _child_ of the `hero div` element, and one which is defined as a _number literal_
  value. We'll use the latter when we're calculating the `textShadow` distance.

Begin by attaching an _event listener_ to the `hero` div element that will listen for
  'mousemove' events and call upon an _event handler_ function (for brevity's sake, let's
  name that function 'shadow'). Declare a `const` variable 'shadow' and define it as
  an _arrow function_ that accepts an event as a parameter; this is our _event handler_ function.
  In the function body, set two `const` variables as the `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` 
  properties of the `hero` div element. Then declare two `let` variables and define them
  as the _event's `offsetX` and `offsetY` properties_. If the event's current target
  is **different** from the event's originating target (the `hero` div element), increment
  the x & y coordinates by the distance between the current target element and the event's
  **originating target** using the `offsetLeft` and `offsetTop` properties of the original
  target.

Declare two `const` variables and define them as the stretch distance for the `textShadow` property
  on the x & y axis, respectively. Finally, update the `textShadow` style property of the `h1`
  element, using the two `const` variables we just defined as the _horizontal and vertical_
  positions of the shadow.

**Steps:**

1. Attach an _event listener_ to the `hero` div element that will call upon a provided _event handler_
  on the 'mousemove' event.

    ```JavaScript
    hero.addEventListener('mousemove', shadow)
    ```

2. Declare a `const` with a name that matches the event listener's _event handler_ function, 
  and define it as an _arrow function_ which accepts an event as a parameter.

    ```JavaScript
    const shadow = (e) = > { /* ... */ }
    ```

    - Declare two `const` variables and define them as the `offsetWidth` 
      and `offSetHeight` properties of the `hero` div HTML element.

        ```JavaScript
        // Get the width & height properties of the 'hero' div in relation
        // to the window object
        const { offsetWidth: width, offsetHeight: height } = hero;
        ```

    - Declare two `let` variables and define them as the distance of the
      mouse from the event's _target element_ on the x & y axis.

        ```JavaScript
        // Using ES6 object deconstruction
        let { offsetX: x, offsetY: y } = e;

        // Without ES6 object deconstruction
        let x = e.offsetX, y = e.offsetY;
        ``` 

    - If the element that is the _current target_ of the event differs
      from the event's _originating target_, increment the values of the two previously declared
      variables by the distance between the originating target and the current target on the
      x & y axis.

        ```JavaScript
        if (e.currentTarget !== e.target) {
          x += e.target.offsetLeft
          y += e.target.offsetTop
        }

        ```

    - Calculate the stretch distance for the element's shadow on the x & y axis

        ```JavaScript
        const xWalk = Math.round((x / width * walk) - (walk / 2)),
          yWalk = Math.round((y / height * walk) - (walk / 2));
        ```
    
    - Update the `textShadow` _style property_ of the `h1` element.

        ```JavaScript
        text.style.textShadow = `
        ${xWalk}px ${yWalk}px 0 rgba(255,0,255,0.7),
        ${-xWalk}px ${yWalk}px 0 rgba(0,255,255,0.7),
        ${yWalk}px ${-xWalk}px 0 rgba(0,255,0,0.7),
        ${-yWalk}px ${-xWalk}px 0 rgba(0,0,255,0.7)
        `;
        ```

3. Last step is best step! Wrap up **all** of the JavaScript code inside an IIFE 
  (_immediately invoked function expression_).
