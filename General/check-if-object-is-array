The method given in the ECMAScript standard to find the class of Object is to use the toString method from Object.prototype.

if( Object.prototype.toString.call( someVar ) === '[object Array]' ) {
    alert( 'Array!' );
}
Or you could use typeof to test if it is a String:

if( typeof someVar === 'string' ) {
    someVar = [ someVar ];
}
Or if you're not concerned about performance, you could just do a concat to a new empty Array.

someVar = [].concat( someVar );
