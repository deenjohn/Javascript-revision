[[Get]] — The function to call when the property is read from. The default value is
undefined.
[[Set]] — The function to call when the property is written to. The default value is
undefined



var book = {
 _year: 2004,
 edition: 1
};

//property "year" is defined

Object.defineProperty(book, “year”, {
  get: function(){
    return this._year;
 },
 set: function(newValue){ //2005

 if (newValue > 2004) {
   this._year = newValue;
   this.edition += newValue - 2004;
 }
 }
});

console.log(book.edition); //1
book.year = 2005;
console.log(book.edition); //2

Assigning just a getter means that the property
cannot be written to and attempts to do so will be ignored

 Likewise, a property with only a setter cannot be read and
will return the value undefined in nonstrict mode, while doing so throws an error in strict mode.
