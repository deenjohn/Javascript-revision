Introducing the nodeValue property
If you want to change the value of a text node, there is a DOM property called nodeValue that can be used
to get (and set) the value of a node:
node.nodeValue

Notes
For the document itself, nodeValue returns null. For text, comment, and CDATA nodes, nodeValue returns the content of the node. 
For attribute nodes, the value of the attribute is returned.
