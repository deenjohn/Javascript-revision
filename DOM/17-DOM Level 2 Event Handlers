# DOM Level 2 Event Handlers

## DOM Level 2 Events define two methods to deal with the assignment and removal of event handlers: 

> addEventListener() and removeEventListener().

These methods exist on all DOM nodes and accept three arguments: the event name to handle,
the event handler function, and a Boolean value indicating whether to call the event handler
during the capture phase (true) or during the bubble phase (false).

To add an event handler for the click event on a button, you can use the following code:
var btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);
btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
 alert(this.id);
}, false);

This code adds an onclick event handler to a button that will be fired in the bubbling phase (since the last argument is false). 

As with the DOM Level 0 approach, the event handler runs in the **scope of the element on which it is attached** . 

The major advantage to using the DOM Level 2 method for adding event handlers is that multiple event
handlers can be added. Consider the following example:




```
var btn = document.getElementById(“myBtn”);
btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
 alert(this.id);
}, false);

btn.addEventListener(“click”, function(){
 alert(“Hello world!”);
}, false); 
```
