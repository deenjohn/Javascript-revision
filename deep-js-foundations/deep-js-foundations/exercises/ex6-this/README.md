# Exercise 6

1. This exercise is a work-log (aka timesheet) application. Run the fixed version of the exercise ("ex6-fixed.html") in your browser and play around to see the expected behavior.

2. For this exercise, you should only need to make changes to "ex6.js", not the HTML or CSS. The changes are only a few spot changes to code, nothing major.

3. The methods in `Helper` use hard-coded lexical references to their own context object. Let's clean *this* up by using what we learned about `this`!

4. **BONUS:** Can you think of any situations where the `this` references in `Helper` methods might be less reliable (require hard binding, for example?) Are there any other parts of the application that you would refactor to use `this` oriented code?
