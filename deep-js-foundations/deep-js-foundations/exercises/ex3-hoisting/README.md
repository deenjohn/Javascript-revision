# Exercise 3

1. This exercise is a work-log (aka timesheet) application. Run the fixed version of the exercise ("ex3-fixed.html") in your browser and play around to see the expected behavior.

2. For this exercise, you should only need to make changes to "ex3.js", not the HTML or CSS. You should only need to do minor reorganization of code for this exercise.

3. There are several things that can be improved in "ex3.js", including:

	- are there function expressions that should be function declarations instead?
	- can function hoisting be leveraged to improve readability by relocating executable code?

4. **BONUS:** How would you describe to a coworker or boss the improvements in readability after applying your knowledge of hoisting to this code? Write out a few sentences.
